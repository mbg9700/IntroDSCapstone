## INTRODUCTION

This is the third and final section of this project in which I train machine learning models that can classify deaths by homeless status.

In the exploratory data analysis phase I was able to identify a number of independent variables that are strongly associated with homelessness.  These features include sex, race and ethnicity (5 groups including Hispanic as race), place of death (e.g. home, hospital, hospice, etc), manner of death (natural, homicide, suicide, accident, or undetermined), leading cause of death (groupings of ICD 10 codes), educational attainment, age group, type of injury involved in death (no injury, motor vehicle injury, fall, poisoning), and whether underlying cause of death was due to drug or alcohol use.  All predictors are categorical variables.


## I. LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL

### A. Read, subset, and prepare data

I trained a number of logistic regression models and made modifications with each iteration to improve performance as measured by the relative AIC of the models.  Some of the changes I made from one attempt to the next include:

  - removing predictors that did not add information to the model (as indicated by the AIC value in the summary statistics),
  - removing predictors that were not strongly correlated with the outcome in the model (as indicated by the asterisks in the summary statistics),
  - aggregating levels within predictor variables to achieve a minimum cell size of 10 when the predictor was tabulated against the outcome,
  - addressing data imbalance by reducing the number of observations.  I included all deaths to homeless individuals (n = 1,090) and undersampled deaths among persons with home reducing this number from roughly 174,000 observations to 1,500 randomly selected deaths.

set.seed(1234)
split = sample.split(h2$homeless, SplitRatio = 0.65)
HTrain = subset(h2, split==TRUE)
HTest = subset(h2, split==FALSE)

# set reference levels for each dummy variable to be created
HTrain$sex <- relevel(HTrain$sex, ref = "F")
HTrain$race6cat <-relevel(HTrain$race6cat, ref = "White.NH")
HTrain$manner <- relevel(HTrain$manner, ref = "Natural")
HTrain$dplace5cat <- relevel(HTrain$dplace5cat, ref = "Home")
HTrain$educ4cat <- relevel(HTrain$educ4cat, ref =  "HSDipl.OrMore")
HTrain$age4cat <- relevel(HTrain$age4cat, ref = "65+yrs")
HTrain$injury <- relevel(HTrain$injury, ref = "No injury")
HTrain$substance <- relevel(HTrain$substance, ref = "No Substance abuse")
HTrain$LCOD3cat <- relevel(HTrain$LCOD3cat, ref = "LCOD.Chronic")
HTrain$homelessFac <- relevel(HTrain$homelessFac, ref = "With home")

```


### C. Train and evaluate models
  
#### 1a. Model 1: train logistic regression model using package e1071

I trained the first logistic regression model using all predictors except 'injury' (whether the death was caused by homicide, suicide or unintentional injury) because of the high likelihood of multicollinearity with dummy variable manner:suicide and dummy variable injury: suicide. 
  
```{r LogReg model}
model.LR1 <- glm(homeless ~ sex + race6cat + dplace5cat + educ4cat + age4cat + manner + substance + LCOD3cat,
                 data = HTrain, 
                 family = "binomial") 
```

**Table 1 - Summary of logistic regression model 1**
```{r}
summary(model.LR1)
```

Th summary of model 1 in Table 1 above shows:

  1. A number of the predictors are statistically significantly positively associated with being homelessness at death. Many of these make sense given the relationship between homeless status at death and these independent variables as seen in the exploratory data anlaysis phase. These include: 
    - being male, 
    - being American Indian/Native American non-Hispanic,
    - being African American and non-Hispanic,
    - dying in a location designated by the death certifier as "other", "hospital", or "ER",
    - having a high school diploma/GED or less (compared with having some college or higher education), 
    - being between 30 and 64 years old at the time of death,
    - manner of death being homicide or undetermined,
    - dying of drug induced causes,
    - dying of alcohol induced causes.
    
  2. Being non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander is significantly negatively associated with being homeless at death.
  
**Table 2 - Logistic regression model 1 odds ratios and confidence intervals**
```{r}
library(Publish)
publish(model.LR1)
```

Table 2 above converts the coefficients in the model summary above into odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. The odds ratio values indicate the odds of having the characteristic for a person who died homeless compared to someone who had a permanent home at the time of death.  For most of the predictors odds ratios confirm the association with the outcome seen in Table 1.  


**Table 3 - Relative importance of predictors to logistic regression model 1** 
```{r}
varImp(model.LR1)
```

Table 3 indicates that place of death is reported as "other", race/ethnicity reported as "other", being 45 to 64 years old at death, being 30 to 44 years old at death, and having a cause of death related to substance use were some of the most important predictors contributing to the model.  These results reaffirm the results shown in Table 1 as those same variables had higher coefficients and were flagged as being highly statistically signficantly associated with the outcome.  On the other hand, there were some predictors in the model 1 summary table (Table 1) that also had higher coefficient values and were highly statistically signficant that did not appear to contribute as much to the model as the predictors mentioned above.
  
#### 1b. Model 1: evaluate model 1 performance on test data 

I set the threshold probability level at 0.5 i.e. if the model predicts that there's a greater than 0.5 probability that the observation is homeless then it is classified as a homeless death.  Tabulating the predicted values against the actual recorded ones gives the confusion matrix.

```{r}
predict.LR1 <- predict(model.LR1, type = "response", newdata = HTest)

tbl.LR1 <-table(HTest$homeless, predict.LR1 > 0.40)
tbl.LR1

accuracy_LR1 <- round(((tbl.LR1["0","FALSE"] + tbl.LR1["1","TRUE"])/(tbl.LR1["0","FALSE"] + tbl.LR1["1","TRUE"] + tbl.LR1["1","FALSE"]  + tbl.LR1["0","TRUE"]))*100,1)
                                                                 
accuracy_LR1

bltbl <- table(h2$homeless)
bltbl
```

The accuracy of logistic regression model 1 is `r round(((tbl.LR1["0","FALSE"] + tbl.LR1["1","TRUE"])/(tbl.LR1["0","FALSE"] + tbl.LR1["1","TRUE"] + tbl.LR1["1","FALSE"]  + tbl.LR1["0","TRUE"]))*100,1)`.

The baseline accuracy is 1500/(1500+1091) = 58% i.e. if all outcomes were predicted as the most common value (in this case '0' or "With home") my baseline prediction would be accurate for 58% of the observations.

Compared to the baseline accuracy logistic regression model 1 is considerably more accurate.


**Figure 1. ROC curve for logistic regression model 1**

```{r}
library(ROCR)

ROCRpred.LR1 <- prediction(predict.LR1, HTest$homeless)

ROCRperf.LR1 <- performance(ROCRpred.LR1, "tpr", "fpr")

plot(ROCRperf.LR1, colorize=TRUE, print.cutoffs.at = seq(0,1, by=0.1), text.adj = c(-0.2, 1.7))
```


Based on the ROC curve in Figure 1 a 0.5 probability threshold for classifying deaths as homeless vs. with home achieved the highest sensitivity (true positive rate) but decreased the specificity (1-False positive rate).  I will need to check with program staff to see if it is more important to them to achieve a higher specificity (reduce false positives as much as possible) in which case I will rase the threshold to 0.8.

#### 2a. Model 2: train logistic regression model with crossvalidation in Caret package

I created my second logistic regression model using the Caret package.  The package allowed me to specify tuning parameter values such as using ten-fold crossvalidation to get an average of the  model run 10 times.

```{r}
ctrl.LR2 <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", number = 10, savePredictions = TRUE)

model.lr2 <-train(homelessFac ~ sex + race6cat + dplace5cat + educ4cat + age4cat + manner + substance + LCOD3cat,
                  data = HTrain, 
                  family = "binomial",
                  method = "glm",
                  trControl = ctrl.LR2, tuneLength = 5) 

```


#### 2b. Model 2: evaluate logistic regression model 2 using test data

```{r}
predict.lr2 <- predict(model.lr2, newdata = HTest)

confusionMatrix(data = predict.lr2, HTest$homelessFac)
```



## II. NAIVE BAYES CLASSIFIER


```{r}
# get data and restrict to only literal fields
#the literal field in this dataset is called "CODliteral" and contains 
#Cause of death lines a-d, other significant conditions line, and injury
#occurrance literal field.

literal <- read.csv("HomelessFinal.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
literal <- subset(literal, select = c(status, CODliteral))
str(literal)

# set "status" to factor

literal$status <- factor(literal$status)
str(literal$status)
table(literal$status)

# to remove the problem of unbalanced data I will restrict the "with home" class to about 7,500 randomly selected records

h <- subset(literal, status=="Homeless")
